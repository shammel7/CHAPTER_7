# CHAPTER_7
# Adding Animation to an App

I animate the width of a Container widget by tapping it. For example, you could use 
this type of animation to animate a horizontal bar chart.

# Adding the AnimatedCrossFade Widget
This example creates a cross-fade between colors and size by tapping the widget. The widget will crossfade the changing size and color from yellow to green.
